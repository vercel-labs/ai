# Versioning

The AI SDK follows semantic versioning ([Semver](https://semver.org/)) for its releases. This system provides consistent and predictable version numbers that reflect changes to the API.

## Understanding Version Numbers

Each version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Requires code changes due to breaking API updates
- **Minor**: Adds new features without breaking existing code
- **Patch**: Fixes bugs without changing the API

## API Stability Indicators

We use different status indicators to communicate the stability of our APIs:

### Stable APIs

By default, all APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for these features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.

### Experimental APIs

APIs prefixed with `experimental_` (like `experimental_generateImage()`) are in development and can change in minor releases. To use experimental APIs safely:

1. Test them first in development, not production
2. Review release notes before upgrading
3. Prepare for potential code updates

### Deprecated APIs

APIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. To handle deprecations:

1. Switch to the recommended alternative API
2. Follow the migration guide
3. Update your code before the next major release

Each deprecation includes:

- Documentation for the replacement API
- Clear removal timeline
- Step-by-step migration instructions

### Paused APIs

APIs marked as `paused` are temporarily inactive due to external blockers. Development will resume once these blockers are resolved.

## Breaking Changes

When breaking changes are necessary:

1. The major version number increases
2. Release notes detail the changes
3. Migration guides help you upgrade
4. Codemods automate updates where possible

Note: Experimental APIs may have breaking changes in minor releases.

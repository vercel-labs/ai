# Versioning

Each version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Breaking API updates that require code changes.
- **Minor**: Blog post that aggregates new features and improvements over a period of time into a public release that highlights benefits to users.
- **Patch**: New features and bug fixes.

## API Stability Indicators

We use different status indicators to communicate the stability of our APIs:

### Stable APIs

By default, all APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for these features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.

### Experimental APIs

APIs prefixed with `experimental_` (like `experimental_generateImage()`) are in development and can change in minor and patch releases. To use experimental APIs safely:

1. Test them first in development, not production
2. Review release notes before upgrading
3. Prepare for potential code updates

<Note type="warning">
If you use experimental APIs, make sure to pin your AI SDK version number exactly (avoid using ^ or ~ version ranges) to prevent unexpected breaking changes.
</Note>

### Deprecated APIs

APIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. To handle deprecations:

1. Switch to the recommended alternative API
2. Follow the migration guide
3. Update your code before the next major release

Each deprecation includes:

- Documentation for the replacement API
- Clear removal timeline
- Step-by-step migration instructions

<Note>
For major releases, we provide automated codemods where possible to help migrate your code to the new version.
